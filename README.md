### SpaceCommander in Haskell

This is a very small 2D arcade game in the tradition of 
classical shoot'em'up games of the eighties, when computers
as the Commodore 64 ruled the world :) 

The main purpose of this project is actually to show how to write a 
game in the functional language Haskell. 

I am using the sdl2 (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sdl2-2.2.0) 
package to handle the low-level window-managment and OpenGL communication.
